# However, some scripts will fail if it cannot find a binary.
# This setting will pull in the packages required before searching.
# The packages will be subject to an `emerge --update --onshot` on
# the machine's own /etc/portage.
# If you are not using the gd-build-packages.sh script, make sure these packages are installed manually!
